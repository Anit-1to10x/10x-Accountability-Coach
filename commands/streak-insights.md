<steps>
1. Scan all challenges in .streak/challenges/
2. Extract tags and key terms from each session
3. Find overlapping concepts across challenges (compound learning)
4. Detect skill transfer between challenges
5. Analyze behavioral patterns (best days, check-in rates)
6. Find cross-domain correlations (e.g., fitness → productivity)
7. Generate personalized suggestions
</steps>

<output>Compound learning connections, skill transfers, patterns, recommendations</output>
